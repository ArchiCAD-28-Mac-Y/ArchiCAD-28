## Overview

<a href="#">ArchiCAD 28</a> delivers professional-grade BIM through an interface designed for both simplicity and depth. The application serves architects, designers, and building professionals who need comprehensive design and documentation capabilities.

The <a href="#">parametric objects</a> create intelligent building elements with adjustable properties. Windows, doors, stairs, and other components adapt to design requirements automatically.

<a href="#">Library parts</a> provide extensive collection of pre-built architectural elements. Access thousands of objects for efficient design development.

<a href="#">Custom GDL objects</a> extend capabilities through scripted parametric elements. Create firm-specific or project-specific components when needed.

The <a href="#">scheduling and listing</a> extracts quantities and specifications from models automatically. Generate accurate material takeoffs and schedules from BIM data.

<a href="#">Renovation tools</a> manage existing conditions, demolition, and new construction. Document renovation projects with proper phase distinction.

<a href="#">Site modeling</a> creates terrain and landscape context for buildings. Develop complete project environments beyond building footprints.

<a href="#">Structural analysis link</a> connects to engineering software for structural coordination. Share models with structural consultants efficiently.

<a href="#">MEP coordination</a> integrates mechanical, electrical, and plumbing information. Coordinate building systems within the architectural model.

<a href="#">Presentation tools</a> create compelling visuals for client communication. Produce renderings, animations, and virtual reality experiences.

<a href="#">Publishing sets</a> automate drawing package production for deliverables. Generate complete document sets with consistent settings.
